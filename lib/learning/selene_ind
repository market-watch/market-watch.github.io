        <h1>Understanding the Selene Indicator</h1>
        
        <h2>What is the Selene Indicator?</h2>
        <p>The Selene Indicator is a sophisticated tool designed to predict price reversals and corrections in financial markets. By employing a machine learning predictive model, it identifies retracement levels on a candle where a reversal is anticipated. The indicator is most effective on daily and weekly timeframes, making it suitable for both short-term and long-term trading strategies.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The Selene Indicator assesses price action by examining completed candle patterns. This ensures that only valid and reliable data points contribute to the indicator's predictions. The focus on completed candles is crucial, as it eliminates the noise associated with incomplete price movements, leading to more accurate forecasts of market behavior.</p>

        <h2>Daily and Weekly Checks</h2>
        <p>The Selene Indicator operates on a systematic approach to market analysis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily Timeframes:</strong> Every trading day, the indicator scans for the formation of retracement levels, allowing traders to stay informed about potential market reversals. This daily check is essential for active traders who seek to capitalize on short-term fluctuations.</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly Timeframes:</strong> On the last trading day of the week (typically Friday), the indicator performs an in-depth analysis to uncover significant patterns that may have developed throughout the week. This weekly overview is beneficial for swing traders and investors who focus on broader market trends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dynamic Nature of Patterns</h2>
        <p>One of the hallmark features of the Selene Indicator is its adaptability. As new candles form, earlier predictions can be invalidated, leading to the disappearance of previously established retracement levels. This dynamic nature ensures that traders receive up-to-date insights and are alerted to the emergence of new patterns. It's common for a stronger and more reliable pattern to develop after an invalidation, thus providing traders with opportunities to adjust their strategies accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Types of Patterns</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>T1:</strong> Represents a basic retracement level, which is the most frequently encountered. While T1 patterns are common, they may signal less significant market movements.</li>
            <li><strong>T2:</strong> This pattern indicates a higher probability of reversal, providing traders with more confidence in their positions.</li>
            <li><strong>T3:</strong> The rarest and most powerful pattern, T3 offers the strongest correlation to price movements. Traders should pay close attention to T3 patterns, as they often indicate major market reversals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Integrating with the Selene Oscillator</h2>
        <p>The Selene Indicator is not designed to be used in isolation. It works best in conjunction with the Selene Oscillator, a complementary tool that provides additional insights into market momentum. When the Selene Oscillator indicates overbought or oversold conditions, it can reinforce the signals generated by the Selene Indicator, enhancing the overall trading strategy.</p>

        <h2>Trading Strategy</h2>
        <p>Successful trading with the Selene Indicator involves a well-defined entry and exit strategy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entry Conditions:</strong> Traders might consider entering a long position when the Selene Indicator identifies a T2 or T3 retracement level, and the Selene Oscillator confirms oversold conditions. Conversely, for short positions, traders look for T2 or T3 patterns coupled with overbought signals from the oscillator.</li>
            <li><strong>Exit Strategy:</strong> The exit strategy should align with the entry strategy. Traders may choose to exit positions when the oscillator reaches the opposite zone or set risk-reward ratios of 2:1 or 3:1 to manage their trades effectively. This disciplined approach helps to maximize gains while minimizing losses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Selene Indicator is a powerful tool for traders seeking to identify potential market reversals and corrections. By integrating it with the Selene Oscillator and adhering to a well-structured trading strategy, traders can enhance their decision-making process and improve their chances of success in the dynamic world of financial markets.</p>
